To maintain a smooth workflow and ensure contributions are counted:

   - Work on **one issue per branch**.  
   - Create a **new branch for every issue** you work on.  

4. **Sync Before PR:**  
   - Before raising a PR, always sync your fork with the main repository to avoid conflicts.  

5. **Commit Messages:**  
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages.  
   - Reference the issue number in your PR description (e.g., ‚ÄúCloses #XYZ‚Äù).  

6. **Avoid Spam:**  
   - Spamming or irrelevant PRs will be rejected. Only submit meaningful contributions.
